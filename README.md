This project develops a web platform for a real estate agency called **Tatiana's Properties**. The application allows users to list properties for sale or rent, manage properties from a private employee dashboard, and facilitate communication with clients through a contact form. The project is implemented using modern technologies: **Astro** for the frontend with **TypeScript** and **TailwindCSS**, and **Spring Boot** for the backend in **Java**.
